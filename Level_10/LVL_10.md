# Level 10 A

## Artificial Intelligence in Games

Making an AI for a game, even for TicTacToe, might sound daunting but you already know enough about programming to do it! AI is just code that reacts to a game environment with an action.

Try to think of the simplest method of making a move in Tic Tac Toe. Note it's not the same as the worst method, which would be deliberately making moves to help your opponent win.

In TicTacToe the simplest method to make a valid move is to look at each space and place one's X or O mark in the first available space. Available spaces are spaces that are not already occupied by an X or O. This will be how your easy level AI player will make moves!
