# TicTacAIO

Artificial Intelligence Os!

## Instructions

For TicTacAIO you'll just be adding onto your code from 'TicTacToe'. Copy and paste the code into your `ticTacAIO.js` file.

Make buttons to let the user pick between starting a two player game or one player game against your AI player.

Make three levels of AI player:

- Easy : picks the first available space
- Medium : picks any available space randomly
- Hard : picks a winning move if available, blocks opponent's winning moves if they have any, otherwise it picks any available space

Also make a "Challenge Mode" option for the AI difficulty. Make it progressive, so the player has to beat the easy AI, then the medium AI, before they play against the hard AI.

## Instructions for the Extra Challenge Section

TicTacToe is a solved game, meaning that if both players always play their best moves, the game will end in a forced draw.

Try implementing a Very Hard AI player that's unbeatable and uses strategies to win against unskilled players.

First make a 0 player mode to test your Very Hard AI against your Hard AI. Have a limit to the number of matches that will be played. You should be able to view the results of each match.
