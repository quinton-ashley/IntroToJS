# TicTacAIO

Artificial Intelligence Os!

## Instructions

For TicTacAIO you'll just be adding onto your code from 'TicTacToe'. Copy and paste the code from `ticTacToe.js` into your `ticTacAIO.js` file.

Make buttons to let the user pick between starting a two player game or one player game against your AI player. Then remove those buttons from the screen. If the player wants to play agains the AI play have them choose which level of difficulty they want the AI player to be at.

Make three levels of AI player:

- Easy : picks the first available space
- Medium : picks an available space randomly
- Hard : picks a winning move if available, blocks opponent's winning moves if they have any, otherwise it picks any available space

Also make a "Challenge Mode" option for the AI difficulty. Make it progressive, so the player has to beat the easy AI, then the medium AI, before they play against the hard AI.

## CHALLENGE SECTION

TicTacToe is a solved game, meaning that if both players always play their best moves, the game will end in a forced draw.

Try implementing a Very Hard AI player that's unbeatable and uses strategies to win against unskilled players.

Test out your AI with a 0 player mode. Make your Very Hard AI play hundreds of games against your Hard AI. When they finish playing you should be able to view the score and the results of every match.
