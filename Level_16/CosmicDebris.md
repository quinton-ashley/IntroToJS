# Cosmic Debris

It's the FUTURE, the year is 2415, humans travel the cosmos in search of raw materials for earth's megacities. Laser blasts in 2415 don't come cheap though, you only have 3 per ship! But hey, you're an expert pilot, navigating the cosmos should be no problem right? Your ships (two of 'em) will navigate through all varieties of dangerous Cosmic Debris: asteroid fields, the earth orbit satellite cloud, and massive balls of ice.

Cosmic Debris was a game for iPhone I developed during my freshman and sophomore years of college. At the time I had to use Objective-C, which is a crusty old programming language that I am not a fan of, it was a painful experience! I had never finished it but now I've recreated it in JavaScript using QuintOS as an example!

... coming soon
