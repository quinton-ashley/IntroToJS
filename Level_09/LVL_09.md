# Level 09 A

Complete the bonus game, Sokoban, before continuing to level 8. Edit your `load.js` file in the `GAMES` folder.

```js
QuintOS.level = 7;
QuintOS.gameSelect = "Sokoban";
```

After that you can upgrade to level 9! ðŸ¥³

```js
QuintOS.level = 9;
```

Congratulations you've almost completed my IntroToJS course! In this section you'll learn more about the broader Javascript ecosystem and how to use p5.js and QuintOS in your own project.

## Node.js and npm

Node.js is a Javascript runtime that lets you interact with your computer's file system, among other things that you can't do with Javascript inside a web browser.

npm is the nodejs package manager. Javascript developers have posted a lot of Javascript packages on there.
