## Loading and Playing Sounds

Sounds must be loaded before a game begins. You will do this in a separate preload JS file in your game folder.

Example code for playing a jump sound when the player jumps:

```js
// in preload file
let jumpSound = loadSound('/sounds/jumpSound_92.mp3');
```

```js
// in main game file
void keyPressed() {
	if (key == ' ') {
		jumpSound.play();
	}
}
```

## bounce callback

You can make a callback function for when a sprite bounces off another sprite.

```js
ball.bounce(paddle, () => {
	log('ball bounced!');
});
```

## Check if a variable is defined

Sometimes you'll need to check if a variable is defined before you do something with it. If you put a variable that doesn't have a boolean value in a boolean condition by itself, Javascript will evaluate its "truthiness". You can check if a variable exists by putting it on it's own in a boolean condition.

```js
let robot; // robot created but not defined

// only have the robot shoot lasers if it is defined!
if (robot) {
	robot.shootLasers();
}
```

## Check if a variable is undefined

To check if a variable is undefined (false-y), put a negation operator `!` in front of the variable name in the boolean condition. Variables are considered undefined if they were not assigned a value.

```js
let robot;

if (!robot) {
	robot = createRobot();
}
```

## Adding properties to an existing object

Adding properties to an existing object is super easy, just give it a value as if the property already existed!

```js
ball.active = true;
```

## Skip iterations of a for loop

Use `continue` to skip an iteration of a for loop but continue looping. Unlike `break` which is for exiting the loop early.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
	if (i == 2) {
		continue;
	}
	if (i > 5) {
		break;
	}
	console.log(i);
}
```

Console Output:

```txt
0
1
3
4
5
```
