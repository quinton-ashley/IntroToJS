```js
if (num == 8 || 9) {
	await alert('The number is 8 or 9.');
}
```

Which boolean operator corresponds to the results in the following truth table?

Truth Table
x y
0 0 = 0
1 0 = 1
0 1 = 1
1 1 = 1

Rewrite the following code using the boolean operator &&

```js
// Without using boolean operator &&
if (a > 0) {
	if (b > 0) {

} else if (y == 0) {
	console.log('At least one variable is zero!');
} else if (z == 0) {
	console.log('At least one variable is zero!');
}
```
