# SuperJump

Watch this video of Papi Jump one of the most popular games for iPhone when it was released back in 2008:

## Instructions

Make your own version of the Papi Jump game from the video! Use the `Ball` and `Paddle` classes as well as the ball and horizontal paddle sprite art images from Contain. Horizontal paddles will be used for the platforms in this game. Rename the `Paddle` class to `Platform`. Use the mouse to steer the ball.

Try thinking about how to remake this game on your own. Since this is a big challenge, break it down step by step. Start simple and build the game up from there. If you need help you can reference my step by step instructions below.

## Step by Step Instructions

First start out by making a ball "jump" on a platform. Place a platform at the bottom of the screen and place a ball in the middle of the screen. Set the ball's x and y velocity to zero. Drop the ball by decreasing the ball's y velocity. This force of gravity should be acting on the ball on every frame. The ball should fall onto the platform. Make it bounce by inverting the y velocity.

Next set the ball's x velocity to be related to `mouseX`. This way the player should be able to steer the ball with their mouse. Limit the x velocity that the ball can travel at.

Create an array of platforms. Use a `for` loop to create new platforms to add to the array. There should always be a platform within jumping distance of the ball.

When the ball bounces on a platform, move all the platforms and the ball downwards. This makes it seem like a camera is moving up to follow the ball.

In Papi Jump, the ball is able to jump from one side of the screen to the other. For example, when the ball is crossing the edge of the screen on the right side, it can appear to cross onto the left side. Consider how this could be done, however don't implement this feature since your SuperJump game uses mouse cursor controls instead of phone gyroscope tilt controls.

## Extra Feature

Add one additional feature to your SuperJump game that was not included in Papi Jump. If the player does a mouse click right when the ball bounces it should perform a super jump that gives it extra height! If the player's timing is perfect or near perfect they should get a slightly higher super jump. If the player clicks too early or too late they should get less height than a super jump. To make the game more difficult you could even make mistimed super jumps have less height than a normal bounce! Use different animations and sound effects to give the user feedback regarding their jump timing.
