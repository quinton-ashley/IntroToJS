## Creating functions ðŸ‘·

Create functions using the `function` keyword.

```js
// create the function
function sayHello() {
	console.log('hello!');
}

sayHello(); // run the function
```

The code inside a function is not run until the function is called/invoked by using its name and the parenthesis.

## What is p5.play and p5.js? ðŸŒ¸

To make Pong we're going to use p5.play, a 2D game engine made by Computer Science teachers to help you turn your game ideas into JavaScript code!

The lead developer of p5.play is Quinton Ashley, a Computer Science teacher at Crimson Education and the author of these lessons!

p5.play uses p5.js for graphics rendering. We share the Processing Foundation's goal of make coding more accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. Behind the scenes p5.play v3 uses planck (Box2D), a physics simulator that's been used in popular 2D games like Angry Birds and Tiny Wings.

## p5.play Sprites

Take a look at page 0 of the Sprite learn pages on the p5.play website:

---

## spriteArt

The p5.play `spriteArt` function can be used to create images very easily! The first parameter to `spriteArt` is a String representing the color values of pixels.

```js
let img = spriteArt('wgw');
```

This example code would create an image with one white pixel, followed by a green pixel, and then another white pixel.

---

Here's the limited color palette you can use for this game. They are the same colors as the real ZX Spectrum, which this level's computer is based on.

|   letter   |     color      |
| :--------: | :------------: |
| '.' or ' ' | transparent ðŸ”³ |
|    'b'     |    Black â¬›    |
|    'u'     |    blUe ðŸŸ¦     |
|    'r'     |     Red ðŸŸ¥     |
|    'm'     |   Magenta ðŸ”´   |
|    'g'     |    Green ðŸŸ©    |
|    'c'     |    Cyan ðŸ”µ     |
|    'y'     |   Yellow ðŸŸ¨    |
|    'w'     |    White â¬œ    |

## Make Strings with Back-ticks

Back-ticks can also be used to create Strings. Back-ticks look like a backwards apostrophe. They can be found on your keyboard on a special key next to the number 1. The back-tick key also has a squiggly line `~` called a tilde on it.

When back-ticks are used to create Strings, the text inside the back-ticks can go on multiple lines of code and retain these newlines without the use of the newline `\n` character.

```js
let str = `
...yyyy
.yybyybyy
yyyyyyyyyy
yybyyyybyy
.yybbbbyy
...yyyy`;

let img = spriteArt(str);
```

Can you tell what the image is?

---

It's a simple yellow and black smiley face image! ðŸ˜ƒ

---

# Level 02 B

---

## spriteArt scaling

By default each character in the string will be one pixel in the resulting sprite art image. Yet, if you change the scale to 2 then each character in the string will be represented by 4 pixels! This is useful for making larger images.

```js
let face = spriteArt(str, 2);
```

The second input parameter to the `spriteArt` function is an optional scale value. Input parameters are separated by commas.

---

## String.repeat(amount)

To more easily create large Strings you can use a String function called [repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/repeat)

```js
let pattern = '><'.repeat(4);
// pattern -> '><><><><';
```

---

## += operator

The `+=` operator can be used to add to the existing value of a variable.

```js
let story = 'The cow';
story += ' jumped over the moon.';
// story -> "The cow jumped over the moon"
```

You can use `+=` with numbers too!

```js
let x = 5;
x += 2; // shortcut for x = x + 2
console.log(x); // x -> 7
```

`-=`, `*=`, and `/=` operators can also be used with numbers.

# Level 02 C

Take a look at pages 1 and 2 of the Sprite learn pages on the p5.play website:

<https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html?page=1>

---

## Bounces

Objects in p5.play collide by default but the paddle and ball won't do a perfect bounce off the paddle automatically.

```js
function draw() {
	// make the ball bounce off the paddle
	if (ball.collides(paddleLeft)) {
		ball.speed = 1;
	}
}
```

---

# Level 02 D

---

## Keyboard Input

Check if the user is pressing a key:

```js
function draw() {
	if (kb.pressing('ArrowLeft')) {
		player.vel.x = 1; // move the player left
	} else if (kb.pressing('ArrowRight')) {
		player.vel.x = 1; // move the player right
	}
}
```

---

## Drawing text to the screen

Text can be displayed on screen at a given text row and column.

```js
//  (text         , row, col)
text('Hello World!', 10, 12);
```

---

## Level 02 E

---

## Custom collision

Custom collisions handling can be used to change what happens after two sprites collide.

```js
if (laser.collides(shield)) {
	laser.direction = 20; // makes the laser deflect up off the shield
}
```

---

## Adding properties to an existing object

Adding your own properties to an existing object is super easy, just give it a value as if the property already existed!

```js
ball.serveSpeed = 1;
```

---

## Level 02 F

---

## p5.js fill, stroke, and rect

This example `draw` function draws a black background and then a blue rectangle with a red stroke (outline). The `colorPal` function can be use it inside p5.js functions like `background`, `fill`, and `stroke` that expect a color.

```js
function draw() {
	background('b');

	fill('u');
	stroke('r');

	//  ( x,  y,  w,  h)
	rect(10, 20, 15, 55);
}
```

---

## End of Level 02

Remember, don't "reinvent the wheel" if you don't have to! Using a game engine, like p5.play, makes game development easier. Often learning to use existing tools is way easier than writing similar code yourself.

## Computer History: ZX Spectrum

Excerpt from the last paragraph of Chapter 1 of "ZX81 BASIC PROGRAMMING" by Stephen Vickers:

"Whatever else you do, keep using the computer. If you have a question 'What does it do if I tell it such & such?' then the answer is easy:type it in & see. Whenever the manual tells you to type something in, always ask yourself, 'What could I type instead?' & try out your replies. The more of your own stuff you write, the better you will understand the ZX81. (This is called un-programmed learning.) Regardless of what you type in, you cannot damage the computer."

---

This level's computer is based on the ZX Spectrum, an 8-bit personal home computer developed by Sinclair Research. It was first released in the United Kingdom on the 23rd of April 1982 and went on to become Britain's best-selling microcomputer. Watch some of this video to hear what it was like for people to use the ZX Spectrum back then!
