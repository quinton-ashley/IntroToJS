# Level 08 A

Complete the bonus game, SuperJump, before continuing to level 8. Edit your `load.js` file:

```js
QuintOS.level = 8;
QuintOS.gameSelect = 'SuperJump';
```

Start thinking of an idea for your own game or interactive art which I will help you create in Level 9.

After that you can upgrade to level 8! ðŸ¥³

```js
QuintOS.level = 8;
```

## p5.play

[p5.play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) is an addon to p5.js for creating 2D games and interactive art!

## Spritesheets

Check out the p5.play Spritesheet example:

https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/examples/index.html?fileName=animation_sprite_sheet.js

On the right side of the example viewer you should see a little purple inky guy doing a splat. On the left side you can see the individual drawings this animation uses.

Try adjusting the speed of the animation by changing the `frameDelay` of the `explode_animation`.

```js
explode_animation.frameDelay = 8;
```

The default `frameDelay` is 4, the sketch runs at 60fps so the framerate of animations by default is 15fps.

## Making Sprites with multiple animations

The sprites in your game will have different animations. Check out this example:
