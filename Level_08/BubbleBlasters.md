# BubbleBlasters

One of my favorite arcade games is "Super Pang", known as "Super Buster Bros." in North America, released in 1989. The basic gameplay is identical to a much earlier 1983 MSX computer game called Cannon Ball, also released in 1983 on the ZX Spectrum as Bubble Buster. Cannon Ball was made by the Japanese publisher, Hudson Soft, a name you might recognize! They're better known for their collaborations with Nintendo on the Mario Party series.

In this game bubbles appear at the top of the screen and bounce on the floor and walls. Your character moves on the ground and can only shoot straight up at the bubbles. If a bubble touches them, you lose!

Every time a big bubble gets shot it splits into two smaller bubbles.

When the smallest bubbles are shot, they get popped and do not split into new bubbles.

If the player pops all the bubbles they beat that level and move onto the next one.
