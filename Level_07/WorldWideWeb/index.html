				Before the existence of MySpace, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, TikTok, and templating sites like Wix and
				SquareSpace, the only way to have an online prescence was to make your own website.
			</p>

			<p>
				When HTML was created in 1993, making a website was simple and people didn't have high expectations regarding
				what a website should look like or what it should do. People were just excited to be on the net!

				West. Every website had a different design. Even big brands published sites that were super experimental. You
				can take a look at web design from this era on this website:
