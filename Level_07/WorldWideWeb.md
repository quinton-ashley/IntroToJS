# WorldWideWeb

Fully modify the template files `index.html` and `styles.css` to make your own webpage. For this project you only need to create one webpage, not a whole website. Your webpage doesn't need to be a home page. You can make a news article, image gallery, shop, blog post, or social media feed. If you want an extra challenge you can try creating a very simple app, for example: a timer, a metronome, temperature converter, or simple calculator.

## Instructions for PART A

Save your changes and the VSCode Live Server extension
will update the page automatically, no need to reload.

Start adding content to your site and don't be concerned about how it looks for now. If you chose to create a simple app, create some example results.
