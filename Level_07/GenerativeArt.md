# GenerativeArt

Generative art is computer art generated by an algorithm.

Watch the first few minutes of this short film from 1968 to see examples of John Whitney's generative art:

# Instructions for Part A

Create a variable `time` that goes up by .1 every frame (everytime the draw function is run).

Move a point using the `sin` and `cos` functions using the `time` variable.

Move another point using different equations from the first point.

# Instructions for Part B

Join the two points with a line.

Draw a trail of lines following the first line.
