# GenerativeArt

Generative art is computer art generated by an algorithm.

Watch the first few minutes of this short film from 1968 to see examples of John Whitney's generative art:

## Instructions for Part A

Create a variable `time` that goes up by 0.1 every frame (everytime the draw function is run).

Move a point using the `sin` and `cos` functions using the `time` variable.

## Instructions for Part B

Create equation functions that take `t` as an input parameter and return a value for `x` or `y`. Use them to plot points.

```js
point(eqX(time), eqY(time));
```

```js
function eqX(t) {
	return cos(t) * 500;
}
```

Make six unique works of generative art. Create a variable `art` that stores the number of which artwork is being viewed. Use the `art` variable to select which equation your `eqX` and `eqY` functions use.

```js
function eqX(t) {
	if (art == 0) return cos(t) * 500;
	if (art == 1) return sin(t * 2) * 400 + cos(t) * 200;
}
```

Experiment with the color of the background and using an alpha (opacity) value so that the older points fade away.

```js
//   RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA
background(0, 0, 0, 10);
```

You can use any of the p5.js and p5.play functions you've learned to create dynamic generative art based on randomness `random(low, high)` or user input `mouse.x`, `kb.presses(key)`. You can also change the stroke weight, color, and amount of points that each artwork has.

In at least one of your works of generative art, use a for loop to create a trail of points that use decrementally lower values of `time`.

Viewers of your art program should be able to use the arrow keys "ArrowRight" and "ArrowLeft" to change the artwork that is being displayed.

## Instructions for Part C

Use the equations of two points to create a line! Implement `eqX2` and `eqY2` functions.

```js
line(eqX(time), eqY(time), eqX2(time), eqY2(time));
```

Create 6 unique artworks that use the `line` function.

In at least one of your line artworks, use a for loop to create a trail of lines that use decrementally lower values of `time`.
