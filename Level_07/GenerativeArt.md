# GenerativeArt

Generative art is computer art generated by an algorithm.

Watch the first few minutes of this short film from 1968 to see examples of John Whitney's generative art:

## Instructions for Part A

Create a variable `time` that goes up by .1 every frame (everytime the draw function is run).

Move a point using the `sin` and `cos` functions using the `time` variable.

Move another point using different equations from the first point.

## Instructions for Part B

Join the two points with a line.

Draw a trail of lines following the first line.

## Instructions for Part C

Make a gallery of generative art. Create 8 buttons on the bottom of the screen numbered 1-8 that change which of your artworks is displayed. Create 8 different artworks and try to make them all really different!

You can use any of the p5.js and p5.play functions you've learned to create dynamic generative art based on randomness `random(low, high)` or user input `mouse.x`, `kb.presses(key)`. You can also change the strokeWeight, color, and amount of lines that each artwork has. Experiment with the color of the background and using an alpha (opacity) value so that the older lines fade away.

```js
//   RED, GREEN, BLUE, ALPHA
background(0, 0, 0, 10);
```
