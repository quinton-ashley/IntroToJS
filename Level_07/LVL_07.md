## Computer History: IBM 2250

From Wikipedia:

The IBM 2250 Graphics Display Unit was a vector graphics display system. The 2250s CRT measured 21" diagonal, but the useful display area was 12 inch by 12 inch. A light pen was provided as a pointing device, serving the function of the modern computer mouse.

The IBM 2250 was used by John Whitney, the father of computer animation, to make incredible generative art.
