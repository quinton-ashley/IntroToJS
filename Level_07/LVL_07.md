# Level 07 A

Complete the bonus game, QuickTyping, before continuing to level 7. Edit your `load.js` file in the `GAMES` folder.

```js
QuintOS.level = 5;
QuintOS.gameSelect = "Sketchbook";
```

After that you can upgrade to level 7! ðŸ¥³

```js
QuintOS.level = 7;
```

## LCD

LCDs, liquid-crystal displays, were commonly found on early handheld videogame systems due to their energy efficiency. For the Snake game you will use an 28w x 20h LCD with three programmable blocks: `head`, `body`, and `tail`.

```js
pc.lcd(block, x, y, direction);
```
