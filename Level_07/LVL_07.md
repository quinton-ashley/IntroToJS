# Level 07 A

In this section you'll learn more about the broader Javascript ecosystem, web development, and how to use p5.js and QuintOS in your own projects.

## Web Development

Web development is primarily done with three languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Unlike Javascript, [HTML is not a programming language](https://ischool.syr.edu/why-html-is-not-a-programming-language/). HTML forms the skeleton of the website, it denotes structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. On its own it doesn't do anything dynamic.

The syntax of HTML is actually quite clunky by today's standards, each element is a written as a tag. `<body>` for example is called an opening tag which denotes the start of the body element. Opening tags have the name of the element surrounded with greater than and less than symbols. Closing tags use a slash before the name of the element `</body>`.

The elements inside the opening and closing tags of an element are called child elements. The elements that the child elements are inside are called parent elements.

## CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)

CSS has variables, functions, it can do math, has it's own kind of if statements and switch statements, [it is considered to be a programming language by many developers](https://css-tricks.com/is-css-a-programming-language/). Professional front end developers that have advanced knowledge of CSS3, the latest edition of CSS, have created many incredible showcases on [CODEPEN](https://codepen.io).

A lot of web design work is done with sites like SquareSpace and Canva. Web designers also use Adobe XD.

## Aside

Most courses that teach web development actually start by teaching HTML and CSS, since they are the primary languages for creating the visuals of most websites. I don't do that because HTML is not a programming language and neither is basic level CSS. I teach Javascript first to give students an understanding of what programming is.
