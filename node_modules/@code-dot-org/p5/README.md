_This is the [Code.org](https://code.org/) fork of p5.js. You can [check out the main project here](http://p5js.org)!_

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`

## Publishing a new version

_Note:_ This process requires you to be signed in to the NPM CLI with your Code.org credentials.

Run `npm version <newversion>` to publish a new version. This repository has preversion, version, and postversion scripts (see `package.json`), so this method is preferred over `npm publish`.
