# LilyLeap

In this simple two button game, the player controls a frog that can jump a distance of one lilypad or two. There are gaps between some lilypads that the frog must jump over. The goal is to jump over all the lilypads as quickly as possible without falling in the water!

## Instructions for Part A

The starter code for this game doesn't have any animations. The frog is represented by the big rectangle and a lilypad is represented by a small rectangle.

Use a while loop with a counter variable to make more lilypads.

Add an x velocity value to each of the jumps so that the frog moves one lilypad on little jumps and two lilypads on big jumps.

## Instructions for Part B

Use a for loop to make the lilypads.
