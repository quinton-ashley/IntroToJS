# BinaryConverter

A program that can convert binary numbers to decimal and also decimal numbers to binary.

## Instructions for Part A

Before you start working on this program, do a few binary to decimal conversions by hand. Pay attention to the steps you take. This will help you create the algorithm for your program.

Ask the user for a binary number. The QuintOS `prompt` function returns a Number if the user types only digits. Convert the number recieved from the prompt into a String.

Convert it to decimal and display the result! Your program should support up to 4 bit long binary numbers.

Test your program with several different binary numbers.

## Instructions for Part B

Ask the user if they'd like to convert binary to decimal or decimal to binary. Because the screen is so small you can ask them in this way: "B2D or D2B?"

If the user chooses "D2B", ask the user for a decimal number. The program should convert it to binary and display the result! Start with only supporting 4 bit binary numbers.

Edit your program so it can support up to 16 bit long binary numbers for the decimal to binary conversion.

Test your program with a several different decimal numbers.
