# BinaryConverter

A program that converts binary (base 2) numbers to decimal (base 10).

## Instructions for Part A

Before you start working on this program, do a few binary to decimal conversions by hand. Pay attention to the steps you take. This will help you create the algorithm for your program.

Ask the user for a binary number. The program should convert it to decimal and display the result! Your program should support up to 4 bit long binary numbers.

## Instructions for Part B

Ask the user for a decimal number. The program should convert it to binary and display the result! Start with only supporting 4 bit binary numbers.

Edit your program so it can support up to 16 bit long binary numbers for the decimal to binary conversion.
